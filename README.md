# H1N1 Vaccine Prediction Dashboard

This project aims to predict the likelihood of people taking an H1N1 flu vaccine using a Logistic Regression model. The application is built using Streamlit and includes a dynamic dashboard for visualizing data and a prediction interface for estimating vaccine likelihood based on user inputs.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/h1n1-vaccine-prediction.git
cd h1n1-vaccine-prediction

## Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the dataset (dataset.csv) and the trained model (model.pkl) in the project directory.

## Usage
To run the Streamlit application:

## Execute the following command in the project directory:

streamlit run app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to view the application.

## Features

## Dashboard:

1. Dynamic charts visualizing H1N1 vaccine data.
2. Filters for selecting data based on sex, age bracket, income level, and H1N1 worry.

## Model Prediction:
1. Predict the likelihood of taking the H1N1 vaccine based on user input.
2. User inputs include various factors such as doctor recommendation, perceived risks, effectiveness of vaccines, demographic information, and more.

## Data

The dataset (dataset.csv) contains information on various factors that might influence the likelihood of taking the H1N1 vaccine. Some of the key columns include:

1. sex
2. age_bracket
3. income_level
4. h1n1_worry
5. h1n1_vaccine
6. And more...

## Model

The trained logistic regression model (model.pkl) predicts the likelihood of taking the H1N1 vaccine based on features like doctor recommendation, perceived risks, vaccine effectiveness, demographic information, etc.
